Since we have a 2-tailed test, we have to divide alpha by 2, which gives us 0.025. So, if the calculated p-value is less than alpha, we will reject the null hypothesis.

    "A z-test is used for testing the mean of a population versus a standard, or comparing the means of two populations, with large (n ≥ 30) samples, whether you know the population standard deviation or not. It is also used for testing the proportion of some characteristic versus a standard proportion, or comparing the proportions of two populations.\n",

    "An f-test is used to compare variances between 2 populations. The samples can be any size. It is the basis of ANOVA.\n",
